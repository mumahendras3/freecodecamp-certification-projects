      <h2>Timeline of Language Development</h2>
      <ul id="tribute-info">
        <li>1972: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie">Dennis Ritchie</a> created C as an augmented version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language)">B</a>.</li>
        <li>1972 – 1978: C and Unix co-evolved with a goal of increasingly less assembly language in Unix and more portability.</li>
        <li>1978: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan">Brian Kernighan</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie">Dennis Ritchie</a> published the first edition of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">The C Programming Language</a></i>, known to C programmers as <i>K&R</i>, which describes a version of C commonly referred to as <i>K&R C</i>.</li>
        <li>1989: The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute">American National Standards Institute</a> (ANSI) ratified ANSI X3.159-1989 “Programming Language C”, standardizing the C language. This version of C is often referred to as <i>ANSI C</i>, <i>Standard C</i>, or sometimes <i>C89</i>.</li>
        <li>1990: The ANSI C standard (with formatting changes) was adopted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization">International Organization for Standardization</a> (ISO) as ISO/IEC 9899:1990, which is sometimes called <i>C90</i>.</li>
        <li>1999: The ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard was published, revising the C standard further, which is commonly referred to as <i>C99</i>.</li>
        <li>2011: The ISO/IEC 9899:2011 standard was published, revising the C standard even further, which is commonly referred to as <i>C11</i>. The C standards committee adopted guidelines to limit the adoption of new features that had not been tested by existing implementations.</li>
        <li>2018: The ISO/IEC 9899:2018 standard was published, the current standard for the C programming language, which is commonly referred to as <i>C17</i>. It introduces no new language features, only technical corrections, and clarifications to defects in C11.</li>
